**Variability** is a mod made for Minecraft players that are bored with all these useless chest in dungeon... I mean, we only check the chest to find diamonds ?! The armors and weapons are useless !
This mod adds randomness in weapons and armors by giving ranks to weapons. You will now always find a better weapon if you search enought ! It also adds a new block, the golden anvil which is the best tool to improve your smithing skills. Maybe one day you will be the one creating lengendary weapons ?
